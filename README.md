# ABOUT
A friend of mine asked if I knew of a tool that could randomly pick an image from a given folder.
They teach a foreign language class, and wanted to randomly pick an image prompt for their students to have conversations about.
I don't know of such a tool, but I'm trying to learn about web stuff so I figured I'd just make something with webview.
