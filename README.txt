NOTES
- So this isn't done
- This is the first version goign on Github
  - It is here because it is minimally functional
  - I solved the *most frequent* crashes
- This is made for a friend/for fun
  - I don't want crap to reflect myself though

TODO
- Find/make better icons, give credit
- Take better pictures of Leia
- Split code across multiple files for readability
  - Also split css into a separate file
- Make selected folder persistent
- Is there a way to disable seeing pages in a browser?
  - Alternatively maybe just use "more obscure" ports
  - Or use https to prevent snoopers
- Make less frequently repeated random images
- Clean up the /folder and /folder/ handlers
- Make 404 actually work
- Better comments/documentation
- Alert user when they've selected an invalid folder

EVENTUALLY
- How to package assets with binary
  - Don't MACs do special stuff with security?
- A way to change the color scheme from themes
- A way to view thumbnails of all pictures in folder
  - And select the one you want to view
